Allows for tracking the Legion Artifact Tints from anywhere in the game, particularly useful as Legion Remix doesn't have an artifact forge available.

The current available artifact appearances in Legion remix include:
- Classic (Basic class campaign)
- Upgraded
- Valorous (Balance of Power)
- Hidden

Other appearances in Remix are currently unavailable to progress toward - however, many you can unlock via your warband achievements, such as the PvP appearances.

Other features include Hidden Artifact progress tracking, and an indicator to relog if the player has a tint unlocked but does not have it collected as transmog. The addon additionally makes itself accessible via added tabs when you open the remix artifact trait frame.

A chat command to open a standalone frame can be accessed via either of these slash commands:
- /rat
- /remixartifact
