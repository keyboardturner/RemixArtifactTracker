# 0.0.6

Removed 3rd row 3rd tint's obtainable status (+5 keystone complete) - the achievements required to unlock these are not obtainable in remix.

# 0.0.5

Removed hidden artifact obtainable status - Despite Blizzard's bluepost once saying these were going to be obtainable, these are not in fact currently obtainable in remix.

# 0.0.4

quick fix to false desaturated transmog icon on unobtainable tints (oops)

properly re-instated these glorious manual changelogs instead of the auto-generated ones

Potentially fixed the item name not displaying upon first opening of panel


# 0.0.3

Added functionality to track hidden artifact appearances in the swatch tint color tooltip (ie 30 dungeons, 200 world quests, 1000 enemy player kills)

A desaturated transmog icon will appear on tints which are collected but the transmog is not learned. This will indicate a tooltip that states a relog is required for it to take effect (learn the transmog)

# 0.0.2

Added in a tab to the Remix Artifact Frame UI to access the appearances

Fixed rogues having debug settings by accident (you can not in fact access 36 artifacts as a rogue, try as you might to steal them all)

Added a special Evoker artifact :^)

# 0.0.1
